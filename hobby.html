        <h2>David's Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p>David Musacchio's hobbies reflect his deep curiosity and commitment to service. A lifelong learner and reader, David has built a personal library filled with thousands of books on criminal justice, history, fire service, and many other subjects. Reading is more than a pastime for him, it has fueled his curiosity and strengthened his ability to innovate in his consulting work. It's a source of inspiration that continues to shape his outlook and ideas. His home features cozy reading spaces where he enjoys quiet evenings, often with his cats curled up nearby. In addition to his love of books, David has a hands-on interest in interest in fire and rescue safety and detention as well. He has a notable collection of rescue apparatus and detention equipment.If you would like to learn more about David's passion of fire and rescue safety, visit the <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/" target="_blank" class="link">National Fire Protection Association</a> or explore resources from the <a href="https://www.usfa.fema.gov/" target="_blank" class="link">U.S. Fire Administration</a></p>
